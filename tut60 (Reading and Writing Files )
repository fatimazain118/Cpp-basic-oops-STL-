These are some useful classes for working with files in C++

fstreambase
ifstream --> derived from fstreambase
ofstream --> derived from fstreambase

In order to work with files in C++, you will have to open it. Primarily, there are 2 ways to open a file:

--> Using the constructor
--> Using the member function open() of the class

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    string st = "Writing this into the sample60.txt file";

    // Opening files using constructor and writing it
    ofstream out("sample60.txt"); // Write operation   Object “out” is created of the type ofstream and the file “sample60.txt” is passed to it
    out << st;                    //The string “st” is passed to object “out”

    return 0;
}

*****In sample60.txt file***********
Writing this into the sample60.txt file

#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
  string st2;      //We have created a string “st2” which is empty
     
     //We have made a text file “sample60b.txt” and written “Reading from this file” in it

    //Opening files using constructor and reading it
    ifstream in("sample60b.txt");                  //(Object “in” is created of the type instream and the file “sample60b.txt” is passed to it)
    // in>>st2;   to get full line we'll use getline function inplace of this  
    getline(in,st2);

    cout<<st2;  //here only 1st word will be printed

    return 0;
}

Reading from this file                  //here we'll get the contain of sample60b.txt line by line
