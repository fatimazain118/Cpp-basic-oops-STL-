/* Constructors in C++

A constructor is a special member function with the same name as the class. Constructors are used to initialize the objects of its class

Important Characteristics of Constructors in C++

-A constructor should be declared in the public section of the class
-They are automatically invoked whenever the object is created
-They cannot return values and do not have return types
-It can have default arguments
-We cannot refer to their address

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class Complex
{
    int a, b;

public:
    Complex(void);     //Constructor (automatically invoked/call when its created
    void print(void)
    {
        cout << "Complex no. is :" << a << " + " << b << "i" << endl;
    }
};

Complex ::Complex(void)         //Default Constructor (as taking no input, No parameters are passed) of Complex class
{
    a = 0;                      //assign the values to the data members “a” and “b”
    b = 0;
}

int main()
{
    Complex c1,c2;
    c1.print();
    c2.print();              //when we are creating objects the constructor will run for each object and will assign the values.
    return 0;
}
