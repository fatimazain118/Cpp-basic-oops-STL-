Multiple Inheritances in C++
Multiple inheritances are a type of inheritance in which one derived class is inherited with more than one base class. 

/*
 Syntax for inheriting in multiple inheritance
 class DerivedC: visibility-mode base1, visibility-mode base2
 {
      Class body of class "DerivedC"
 };

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base1
{
protected:
    int value1;

public:
    void set_value1(int a)

    {
        value1 = a;
    }
};

class base2
{
protected:
    int value2;

public:
    void set_value2(int b)
    {
        value2 = b;
    }
};

class Derived : public base1, public base2
{
public:
    void show()
    {
        cout << "Value 1st is :" << value1 << endl;
        cout << "Value 2nd is :" << value2 << endl;
        cout << "Sum of 1st value and 2nd value is :" << value1 + value2 << endl;
    }
};

int main()
{
    Derived d;
    d.set_value1(3);
    d.set_value2(2);
    d.show();

}


/*
The inherited derived class will look something like this:
Data members:
    value1 --> protected
    value2 --> protected

Member functions:
    set_value1() --> public
    set_value2() --> public
    show() --> public
