Destructor in C++
A destructor is a type of function which is called when the object is destroyed. 
Destructor never takes an argument nor does it return any value. 


//these are use for dealocation of memory which constructor have taken
//it's run by compiler implicitly

 #include<iostream>
 using namespace std;
 
int count = 0;

 class num{
public:
num(){
    count++;
    cout<<"This is the time when constructor is called for object "<<count<<endl;

}

~num(){
    cout<<"This is the time when destructor is called for the object "<<count<<endl;
    count--;
}
 };


 int main(){
 cout<<"we are inside the main function"<<endl;
 cout<<"Creating our first object n1"<<endl;
 num n1;
 {
     cout<<"Entering this block"<<endl;
     cout<<"Creating two more objects"<<endl;
     num n2, n3;
     cout<<"Exting this block"<<endl;
 }    

 cout<<"Back to main"<<endl;
     return 0;
 }

 ****************Output****************
 
we are inside the main function
Creating our first object n1
This is the time when constructor is called for object 1     
Entering this block
Creating two more objects
This is the time when constructor is called for object 2     
This is the time when constructor is called for object 3     
Exting this block
This is the time when destructor is called for the object 3  
This is the time when destructor is called for the object 2  
Back to main
This is the time when destructor is called for the object 1
