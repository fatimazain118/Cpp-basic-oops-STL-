An STL is a library of generic functions and classes which saves you time and energy which you would have spent constructing for your use. This helps you reuse these well
tested classes and functions umpteenth number of times according to your own convenience. 

We have three components in STL:

Containers
Algorithm
Iterators

Containers:

Container is an object which stores data. We have different containers having their own benefits. These are the implemented template classes for our use, which can be used just
by including this library. You can even customise these template classes.


Algorithms:

Algorithms are a set of instructions which manipulates the input data to arrive at some desired result. In STL, we have already written algorithms, for example, to sort some
data structure, or search some element in an array. These algorithms use template functions. 

Iterators:

Iterators are objects which refer to an element in a container. And we handle them very much similarly to a pointer. Their basic job is to connect algorithms to the container 
and play a vital role in manipulation of the data.
