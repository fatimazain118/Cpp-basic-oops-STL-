Pointers in C++
Pointers are variables that are used to store the address. Pointers are created using “*”

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int a=4;
    int* p = &a;
    cout<<"Value of a is :"<<*(p)<<endl;

    //***new keyword*****
    int *ptr =new int(40);                     //We created a int pointer “ptr” and dynamically created a int which has value “40” and assigned that value to pointer “ptr”
    cout<<"Value at address ptr is :"<<*(ptr)<<endl;
    return 0;
}

********Output**************
Value of a is :4
Value at address ptr is :40

#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    int *arr = new int[3];          //We created an integer pointer “arr” and dynamically created an array of size three which is assigned to the pointer “arr”
    arr[0] = 10;
    arr[1] = 5;
    arr[2] = 20;
    cout << "The value of arr[0] is :" << arr[0] << endl;
    cout << "The value of arr[1] is :" << arr[1] << endl;
    cout << "The value of arr[2] is :" << arr[2] << endl;
    return 0;
}

*******Output***********
The value of arr[0] is :10
The value of arr[1] is :5
The value of arr[2] is :20

**********Output*************
The value of arr[0] is :17137448              //garbage value because we have used “delete” keyword before printing the values due to which the space used by an array gets
                                                     free and we get the garbage value in return.
The value of arr[1] is :17105088
The value of arr[2] is :20
